# Semantic HTML5 Accessibility

We worked off of www.bestbuy.com to construct this semantic HTML5 file, with a focus on accessibility.

Some challenges we came across were the popup box that comes up on initial page load, and the dropdown menus that required visibly hiding specific content as well as hiding from screen readers.

We also tried to include as much reusable chunks of code as possible; for example, in the second section with the three columns we were able to structure each div identically with different content.
